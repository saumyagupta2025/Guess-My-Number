# Guess-My-Number

This is a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number between 1 and 25. If the guessed number is higher than the secret number, the message "Too high!" is displayed, and if the guessed number is lower than the secret number, the message "Too low!" is displayed. The user has 20 attempts to guess the secret number.

If the user guesses the secret number correctly, the message "Correct Number!" is displayed. The user's high score is updated if they beat their previous high score. If the user is unable to guess the secret number within the 20 attempts, the message "You lost the game!" is displayed.
